 Area::DrawFilledRect probably flickers. We had to make it update each square you draw rather than do them all at once last because
 the updaterect that it issues fails if your area is not the desktop and therefore 0,0 based. what it needs to do is recurse to desktop to find the rect.
 even if it does this, will it work if the rect is partly off screen and therefore clipped?

 There's a bug in the dragging. See for example the sliders in the sprite editor. the first pos to drag to is skipped the first time.


 singlelinetext editor currently is very simple: just press keys or use backspace. change it to handle left and 
 right cursor keys and delete and draw the cursor

 do we need a keypress event? at the moment it's just keydown and keyup

 change the keydown to in single line text edit to not redraw the whole control
